# Website for learning

## Objective
This is going to be a website for learning coding and certain computer science topics mainly just for myself. The idea is to learn and build while I learn- but also try to understand topics in a way that would also allow me to teach others these ideas. I have no intention for this to be a course for others, and surely there will be a lot of mistakes. But my hope is that this approach will help me learn better, and also apply what I learn at the same time. This is just for me. But if you happen to find this- feel free to pick it apart.
