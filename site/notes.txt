To do list:

-make nav bar a drop down bar (done)
    -add css to dropdown boxes
    -possibly drop down for links that follow

-possible side nav bar within each topic for all sub-topics

-current back nav:
    -Create a base html file for this to inherit

-fix code boxes, and add syntax color coding
	-probably solve this with javascript

-fix the page width and sizing to apply to the base.html file for all htmls

-create a class of attributes specific for titles, h1s, h2s, paragraphs, etc.. so css can be more modular and consistent to add/change

-possibly add top margin to text boxes
