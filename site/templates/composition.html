	<h1 class="my-10 text-yellow-100 text-2xl">Composition</h1>
	<p>
		Composition is a design principle in OOP where a class (the "composite"
		or "parent") is made up of other classes (the "components" or
		"children"). It represents a "part-of" relationship and is a strong form
		of aggregation.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mt-16 text-yellow-100 text-xl">Key Points:</h2>
	<div class="text-left">
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Definition:</h3>
		<p>
			Composition is a relationship where one class (The composite)
			contains an instance of another class (the component). The component
			is part of the composite. For example, a Car might have an Engine.
			The car is the whole entity, and the engine is part of the car.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Dependence:</h3>
		<p>
			In a composition relationship, the component cannot exist
			independently of the composite. If the composite is deleted, the
			component is also deleted. For example, if you deleted a Car object,
			the Engine object is also deleted because it's part of the car.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Lifecycle:</h3>
		<p>
			The lifecycle of the component is managed by the composite. the
			component is created when the composite is created, and deleted when
			the composite is deleted.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Direction:</h3>
		<p>
			Composition is typically an one-way relationship. The composite
			knows about the component, but the component does not know about the
			composite.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-5 mt-16 text-yellow-100">Example:</p>

			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
<code>
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine_type):
        self.model = model
        self.engine - Engine(engine_type) # the Car creates an Engine

car = Car("Toyota", "V8")   # create a Car instance with an Engine
</code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			In this example, the [ Car ] class has a composition relationship
			with the [ Engine ] class. The [ Car ] creates an [ Engine ] when
			it's created, so the [ Engine ] is part of the [ Car ] and can't
			exist independently.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			The key difference between this example and the example dealing with
			aggregation lies in the lifecycle and dependency of the [ Engine ]
			object with respect to the [ Car ] object.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-10 text-yellow-100">In Aggregation:</h3>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"

<code>
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine    # the Car has an Engine

engine = Engine("V8")           # create an Engine instance

car = Car("Toyota", engine)     # create a Car instance with the Engine
</code>
</pre>
		<p>
			The engine instance is created independently of the [ Car ]
			instance. The [ Car ] instance then takes an existing [ Engine ]
			instance as a parameter. This means the [ Engine ] can exist without
			the [ Car ], and if the [ Car ] is deleted, the [ Engine ] continues
			to exist. This is a characteristic of aggregation.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-10 text-yellow-100">In Composition:</h3>

<code>
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine_type):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = Engine(engine_type)   # the Car creates and Engine

car = Car("Toyota", "V8")       # create a Car instance with an Engine
</code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			The [ Car ] instance creates its own [ Engine ] instance when it's
			constructed. The instance cannot exist without the [ Car ] instance,
			and if the [ Car ] is deleted, the [ Engine ] is also deleted. This
			is a characteristic of composition.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			So, the main difference is about the dependency and lifecycle of the
			[ Engine ] with respect to the [ Car ]. In aggregation, the [ Engine
			] can exist independently, while in composition, the [ Engine ] is
			fully dependent on the [ Car ].
