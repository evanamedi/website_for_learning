			A class is a blueprint or prototype the defines the variables and
			the methods (functions) common to all objects of a certain kind.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-5">An example of a class in Python would be:</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
<code>
class Car: 
	def __init__(self, brand, model, year): 
		self.brand = brand 
		self.model = model 
		self.year = year 
		
		def start_engine(self): 
			print("Engine Started")
</code>
		</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			In this example, [ Car ] is the class. It has an __init__ method
			that is used to initialize new objects of this class, and a [
			start_engine ] method that all [ Car ] objects will have.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			An object is an instance of a class. You can create an object of the
			[ Car ] class like so:
		</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white rounded-md overflow-auto max-w-2xl mx-auto my-4"
		>
    <code>
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Supra", 2021)
    </code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			In this example, [ my_car ] is an object of the [ Car ] class, with
			brand "Toyota", model "Corolla", and year 2021. You can call the
			methods of the class on this object like this:
		</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white rounded-md overflow-auto max-w-2xl mx-auto my-4"
		>
			<code>
my_car.start_engine()	<span class="comment"># prints "Engine started"</span>
    </code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			Each object has its own values for the variables defined in the
			class, and can use the methods defined in the class. You can create
			as many objects of a class as you need, and they are all independent
			of each other. If you change a variable in one object, it does not
			affect other objects.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-5">
			In summary, a class is like a blueprint, and an object is something
			you build based on that blueprint. The class defines what variables
			and methods an object will have, and the object is an instance of
			the class with actual values.

		Benefits of using classes and objects in OOP:
	</h3>
	<div class="text-left">
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Modularity:</h4>
		<p>
			The source code for an object can be written and maintained
			independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an
			object can be easily passed around inside the system.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Information-hiding:</h4>
		<p>
			By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its
			internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Code Re-usability:</h4>
		<p>
			If an object already exists (perhaps written by another person), you
			can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to
			implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can
			then trust to run your own code.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Plug-ability & Debugging Ease:</h4>
		<p>
			If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply
			remove it from your application and plug in a different object as
			its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in
			the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire
			machine.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Encapsulation:</h4>
		<p>
			A class or object can encapsulate functionality and data into one
			reusable package. the data (attributes) and code (methods) are tied
			together as a self-contained unit called an object. This
			encapsulation helps manage complexity by keeping the interactions
			between objects under control.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Inheritance:</h4>
		<p>
			Classes can inherit common properties and functionality from other
			classes. This allows for more efficient and consistent code by
			allowing classes to share, extend, and override configurations and
			behaviors defined in other classes.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Polymorphism:</h4>
		<p>
			Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types
			of objects at runtime. This means that different classes can define
			the same method or property and you can use objects of different
			classes interchangeably.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-10 mb-10">
			These benefits make OOP a popular choice for large, complex software
			systems and applications where ease of maintenance, rapid
			development, and code reusability are important.
