	<h1 class="my-10 text-yellow-100 text-2xl">Inheritance</h1>
	<div class="text-left">
		<p class="margin-top">
			Inheritance is a fundamental principle of OOP that allows one class
			to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes
			the concept of reusability and is a way to create a new class using
			properties of an existing class without modifying it.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h2 class="mt-16 text-yellow-100 text-xl">Key Concepts:</h2>
	<div class="text-left">
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Base Class (Parent Class):</h3>
		<p>
			The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the
			base case or parent class.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Derived Class (Child Class):</h3>
		<p>
			The class that inherits properties from another class is known as
			the derived class or child class.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Inheritance Types:</h3>
		<p>
			There are several types of inheritance, including single, multiple,
			multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance. The type of
			inheritance implemented depends on the programming language used.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Method Overriding:</h3>
		<p>
			In the derived classes, you can modify the behavior of methods
			inherited from the base class. This is known as method overriding.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Access Modifiers:</h3>
		<p>
			These define the accessibility of the properties and methods of a
			class. Common access modifiers include public, private, and
			protected.
		</p>

		Example of inheritance in Python:
	</h2>
	<div class="text-left">
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
        <code>
class Animal:	        # base class
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        pass	        # to be defined by subclass
    
class Dog(Animal):	    # derived class
    def speak(self)
        return "woof!"
    
class Cat(Animal):	    # derived class
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
        </code>
</pre>
		<p>
			In this example, [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] classes inherit from the Animal
			class. Both [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] override the [ speak ] method of
			Animal. Now, if you create instance of [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] you can
			call the [ Speak ] method on them:
		</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
        <code>
fido = Dog("Fido")
print(fido.speak())		    # prints "Woof!"

whiskers = Cat("Whiskers")
print(whiskers.speak())		# prints "Meow!"
        </code>
</pre>
		<p>
			Inheritance allows for more organized and manageable code, making it
			easier to create and maintain applications. The derived classes have
			their own methods and can also use the methods of the base class,
			reducing code duplication.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-top">Three more Examples:</p>
		<p class="margin-top">Using the [ super() ] function:</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
            <code>
class Mammal:
    def __init__(self, mammalName):
        print(mammalName, " is a warm-blooded animal.")

class Dog(Mammal):
    def __init__(self):
        print("Dog has four legs.")
        super().__init__("Dog")

d1 = Dog()
            </code>
</pre>
		<p>The output would be:</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
        <code>
&gt;&gt;Dog has four legs.
&gt;&gt;Dog is a warm-blooded animal.
        </code>
</pre>
		<p>
			Breakdown: When [ d1 = Dog() ] is executed, it called the [ __init__
			] method in the dog class. The [ Dog ] classes [ __init__ ] method
			first prints "Dog has four legs." Then, [ super().__init__("Dog") ]
			is called. This calls the [ __init__ ]method of the Mammal class
			(the parent class), passing "Dog" as an argument. The mammal classes
			[ __init__ ] method prints "Dog is a warm-blooded animal."
		</p>
		<p class="mt-10">
			Python supports multiple inheritance, where a class can be derived
			from more than one base classes:
		</p>

		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
        <code>
class Animal:
    def eats(self):
        return "Eats food"

class Bird:
    def flies(self):
        return "Flies in the sky"

class Sparrow(Animal, Bird):
    pass

s = Sparrow()
print(s.eats())		<span class="comment"># prints "Eats food"</span>
print(s.files())	<span class="comment"># prints "Flies in the sky"</span>
        </code>
</pre>

		<p>
			In this example, [ Sparrow ] is derived from both [ Animal ] and [
			Bird ] classes, and inherits methods from both.
		</p>
		<p>Method Overriding:</p>
		<p>
			In Python, method overriding occurs by simply defining in the child
			class a method with the same name of a method in the parent class.
		</p>

		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
        <code>
class Bird:
    def intro(self):
        print("There are many types of birds.")

    def flight(self):
        print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

class sparrow(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Sparrows can fly.")

class ostrich(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

b1 = Bird()		
b2 = sparrow()	
b3 = ostrich()	

b1.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
b1.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Most of the birds can fly but some cannot."</span>

b2.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
b2.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Sparrows can fly."</span>

b3.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
b3.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Ostriches cannot fly."</span>
        </code>
</pre>

		<p>
			In this example, sparrow and ostrich classes override the flight
			method of the bird class
		</p>
		<p>
			When [ b1.intro() ] and [ b1.flight() ] are called, it prints "There
			are many types of birds." and "Most of the birds can fly but come
			cannot." because [ b1 ] is an instance of the [ Bird ] class.
		</p>
		<p>
			When [ b2.intro ] and [ b1.flight ] are called, it prints "There are
			many types of birds." and "Sparrows can fly." because b2 is an
			instance of the sparrow class. The [ intro() ] method is inherited
			from the [ Bird ] class and the [ flight() ] method is overridden in
			the [ sparrow ] class.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-8 mb-10">
			When [ b3.into() ] and [ b3.flight() ] are called, it prints "There
			are many types of birds." and "Ostriches cannot fly." because [ b3 ]
			is an instance of the [ ostrich ] class. The [ intro() ] method is
			inherited from the [ Bird ] class and the [ flight() ] method is
			overridden in the [ ostrich ] class.
