	<h1 class="h1Title">Inheritance</h1>
		<p class="pText">
			Inheritance is a fundamental principle of OOP that allows one class
			to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes
			the concept of reusability and is a way to create a new class using
			properties of an existing class without modifying it.
		</p>
		<div class="paraBreak">
	<h2 class="h2Title">Key Concepts</h2>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Base Class (Parent Class)</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the
			base case or parent class.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Derived Class (Child Class)</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			The class that inherits properties from another class is known as
			the derived class or child class.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Inheritance Types</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			There are several types of inheritance, including single, multiple,
			multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance. The type of
			inheritance implemented depends on the programming language used.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Method Overriding</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			In the derived classes, you can modify the behavior of methods
			inherited from the base class. This is known as method overriding.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Access Modifiers</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			These define the accessibility of the properties and methods of a
			class. Common access modifiers include public, private, and
			protected.

		Examples of Inheritance In Python

        <code class="language-python">
class Animal:	        # base class
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        pass	        # to be defined by subclass
    
class Dog(Animal):	    # derived class
    def speak(self)
        return "woof!"
    
class Cat(Animal):	    # derived class
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
        </code>
</pre>
		<p class="pText">
			In this example, [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] classes inherit from the Animal
			class. Both [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] override the [ speak ] method of
			Animal. Now, if you create instance of [ Dog ] and [ Cat ] you can
			call the [ Speak ] method on them:
		</p>
		<pre
			class="codeBox"

        <code class="language-python">
fido = Dog("Fido")
print(fido.speak())		    # prints "Woof!"

whiskers = Cat("Whiskers")
print(whiskers.speak())		# prints "Meow!"
        </code>
</pre>
		<p class="pText">
			Inheritance allows for more organized and manageable code, making it
			easier to create and maintain applications. The derived classes have
			their own methods and can also use the methods of the base class,
			reducing code duplication.

		<h3 class="h3Title">Using the [ super() ] function</h3>
		<pre

class Mammal:
    def __init__(self, mammalName):

</pre>
		<p class="pText">
			Breakdown: When [ d1 = Dog() ] is executed, it called the [ __init__
			] method in the dog class. The [ Dog ] classes [ __init__ ] method
			first prints "Dog has four legs." Then, [ super().__init__("Dog") ]
			is called. This calls the [ __init__ ]method of the Mammal class
			(the parent class), passing "Dog" as an argument. The mammal classes
			[ __init__ ] method prints "Dog is a warm-blooded animal."

		<h3 class="h3Title">Method Overriding</h3>
		<p class="pText">
			In Python, method overriding occurs by simply defining in the child
