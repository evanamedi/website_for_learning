	<h1 class="my-10 text-yellow-100 text-2xl">Encapsulation</h1>
	<p class="text-left">
		Encapsulation is one the fundamental concepts in OOP. It describes the
		idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
		This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and
		can prevent the accidental modification of data.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mt-16 text-yellow-100 text-xl">Breaking it down:</h2>
	<div class="text-left">
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Data Hiding:</h3>
		<p>
			The implementation of the class is hidden from other classes, and
			can only be accessed through the methods of their current class.
			This is also known as data hiding.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Accessors and Mutators:</h3>
		<p>
			To achieve encapsulation in Python, you can use private attributes
			and provide public getter and setter methods to modify and access
			the attributes. These are often referred to as accessors (getters)
			and mutators (setters).
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Abstraction:</h3>
		<p>
			Encapsulation also allows a class to change its implementation
			without affecting other parts of the code, which is known as
			abstraction.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mb-5 mt-16 text-yellow-100">Example in Python:</h4>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
    <code>
class Computer:		            # define a class named Computer
    def __init__(self):		    # initialize method or constructor for the class
        self.__maxprice = 900   # private attribute, not directly accessible from outside the class

    def sell(self):		        # public method to print the selling price
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):	# public method (setter) to set the price of the computer
        self.__maxprice = price 	# modifying the private attribute within the class# create an object of the computer class

c.sell()                # call the sell method, it will print the initial price

c.__maxprice = 1000     # try to directly change the price
c.sell()                # call the sell method, it will still print the initial price because we can't change it directly using setter function                                   
                        # use the setter method to change the price
c.setMaxPrice(1000)     # now, when we call the sell method, it will print the updated price
c.sell()
    </code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			In the script we defined a [ Computer ] class. We are using [
			__init__() ] method to store the maximum selling price of [ Computer
			]. We tried to modify the price. However, we can't change it because
			Python treats the [ __maxprice ] as private attributes.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			As a result, to change the value, you have to use a setter method [
			setMaxPrice() ] which takes price as parameter.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">The output would be:</p>
		<p></p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
    <code>
&gt;&gt;Selling Price: 900
&gt;&gt;Selling Price: 900
&gt;&gt;Selling Price: 1000
    </code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			Encapsulation helps us to avoid data being modified accidentally and
			provides a way to protect and control access to attributes in a
			class.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			Another way to sum it up: The [ Computer ] class encapsulates the [
			__maxprice ] attribute and provides the [ sell ] method to display
			it, and the [ setMaxPrice ] method to change it. The [ __maxprice ]
			attribute is not directly accessible from outside the class - trying
			to change it directly won't have any effect. Instead, you have to
			use the [ setMaxPrice ] method to modify it.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-5 mt-16 text-yellow-100">Another Example:</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			A setter method provides controlled access to modify the values of
			private attributes. This is useful because you can add checks or
			validation within the setter method to prevent invalid or
			inconsistent states for your objects.
		</p>
		<pre
			class="p-1 bg-forest text-white font-mono rounded-md overflow-auto my-4"
		>
    <code>
class Myclass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__my_attribute = 0

    def set_my_attribute(self, value):
        if value &lt; 0:
            raise ValueError("Value cannot be negative")
        self.__my_attribute = value

obj = Myclass()
obj.set_my_attribute(10)	# this modifies the __my_attribute value to 10
        </code>
</pre>
		<p class="my-5">
			In this example, [ set_my_attribute ] is a setter method that
			modifies the value of [ __my_attribute ]. It also includes a check
			to ensure that the value cannot be set to a negative number. If you
			try to set it to a negative number, it will raise a ValueError.

		Some Best Practices For Using Encapsulation In OOP:
	</h2>
	<div class="text-left my-10">
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Data Hiding:</h3>
		<p>
			Keep the data hidden and not directly accessible from outside the
			class. Use private visibility for attributes which should not be
			accessible directly.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Use Accessors and Mutators:</h3>
		<p>
			Provide public getting and setter methods (accessors and mutators)
			to access and modify the private attributes of a class. This allows
			you to control how important variables are read and written to.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Validation:</h3>
		<p>
			You can add validation logic in setter methods to protect your data
			from getting into an inconsistent or invalid state.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Abstraction:</h3>
		<p>
			Encapsulation is a way to achieve data abstraction. The user will
			have the information on what methods do, but they won't need to know
			how they do it.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Reduce Coupling:</h3>
		<p>
			Encapsulation can help reduce coupling between different parts of
			your program, making it easier to modify without affecting other
			parts of the code.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Consistency:</h3>
		<p>
			Be consistent in how you apply encapsulation in your code. If you
			start using getters and setters for accessing properties of the
			class, stick to it throughout your code.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Avoid Excessive Use:</h3>
		<p>
			While encapsulation is important, it's also crucial not to overuse
			it. Not every single variable needs to be private with getters and
			setters. If a variable doesn't need any special behavior or
			constraints, it might not need to be encapsulated.
		</p>
