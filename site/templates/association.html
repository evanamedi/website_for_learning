	<h1 class="h1Title">Association</h1>
	<p class="pText">Association represents a relationship between two or more objects</p>
	<h2 class="h2Title">Key Points</h2>
	<div class="bodyDiv">
		<h3 class="h3Title">Definition:</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			Association is a "using" relationship between two or more objects.
			It's a way for one objects to interact with another, without
			necessarily having a strong dependency. For example, a [ Driver ]
			object might have an association with a [ car ] object, because the
			driver uses the car
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Multiplicity:</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or
			many-to-many. For example, a [ Teacher ] object and a [ Student ]
			object could have a many-to-many association, because a teacher can
			teach many students, and a student can have many teachers.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Directionality:</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			Association can be unidirectional or bidirectional. In a
			unidirectional association, one object is aware of another and can
			interact with it, but not vice versa. In a bidirectional
			association, both objects are aware of each other.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">Navigation:</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			The direction of the association between two classes is called
			navigation. It can be either from one class to another or vice
			versa, or both.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3Title">
			Association vs Aggregation vs Composition:
		</h3>
		<p class="pExplain">
			These are three types of relationships in OOP. Association is the
			most general, aggregation is a special form of association (a
			"has-a" relationship, where the child can exist independently of the
			parent), and composition is a stronger form of aggregation (where
			the child cannot exist independently of the parent).

		<p class="pText">
			In this example, the [ Driver ] class has an association with the [
			Car ] class, because it uses a [ Car ] object in its [ drive ]
			method. This is a one-to-one, unidirectional association.
		</p>
		<p class="pText">
			This is a one-to-one relationship because one instance of the [
			Driver ] class is associated with one instance of the [ Car ] class
			in the drive method. The [ drive ] method is called on one [ Driver
			] instance and takes one [ Car ] instance as an argument.
		</p>
		<p class="pText">
			It's important to note that this doesn't mean a [ Driver ] can only
			ever driver one [ Car ] or vice versa. If you had multiple [ Car ]
			instances, you could call [ drive ] on the same [ Driver ] with each
			[ Car ]. But in the context of a single call to [ drive ], it's a
			one-to-one relationship because one [ Driver ] is driving one [ Car
			].

			In this code, the [ Teacher ] class has a method [ add_student ]
