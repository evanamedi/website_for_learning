	<h1 class="h1Title">Polymorphism</h1>
	<p class="pText">
		The word "Polymorphism" comes from Greek and means "many shapes". In
		programming, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many
		forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent
		class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

	<h2 class="h2Title">Key Points</h2>
        <h3 class="h3Title">Subtyping</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Subtyping, also known as subtype polymorphism, is a form of
		polymorphism in which a subclass is datatype that is a subtype of a
		superclass. The superclass can be used to refer to the subclass object.
		In other words, a reference variable of a superclass can point to an
		object of the subclass.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Method Overriding</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass
		to provide a different implementation for a method that is already
		defined in its superclass. This is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Operator Overloading</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Operator overloading is a type of polymorphism in
		which an operator is overloaded to provide the special meaning to the
		user-defined data type. Operator overloading is used to perform
		operations on user-defined data type like complex numbers, fractions,
		etc.

	<p class="pText">
		In the above program, we defined two classes [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich
		], both are subclasses of [ Bird ]. A method named [ flight ] is created
		in [ Bird ] class and overridden in both subclasses. This is a perfect
		example of polymorphism as the method [ flight ] is taking multiple
		forms.
	</p>
	<p class="pText">
		Polymorphism allows us to define methods in the child class with the
		same name as defined in their parent class. As the key aspect of
		polymorphism is that it provides flexibility and loose coupling so that
		code can be extended and easily maintained over time.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-16">
		The previous explanation focused on inheritance. Inheritance is a
		mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a
		hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. In the
		example, [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ] classes are derived from the [ Bird
		] class, hence they inherit the intro method from the [ Bird ] class.
	</p>
	<p class="pText">
		The current explanation focuses on polymorphism, which is a concept that
		allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a
		superclass. In the context of the example, both [ sparrow ] and [
		ostrich ] classes override the [ flight ] method of the [ Bird ] class.
		When we call the [ flight ] method on an object of type [ Bird ], [
		sparrow ], or [ ostrich ], the appropriate version of the method is
		executed based on the actual type of the object. This is polymorphism in
		action.

<div class="paraBreak">
	<h2 class="h2Title">Further Explanation</h2>
	<div class="bodyDiv">
    <h3 class="h3Title">Inheritance</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Is the mechanism where a class (the subclass) can derive or
		inherit properties and methods from another class (the superclass). In
		the given example, [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ] are subclasses that
		inherit from the [ Bird ] superclass, and this they inherit the [ into ]
		and [ flight ] methods.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Polymorphism</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		On the other hand, is the ability of the subclasses to
		provide their own specific implementation of a method that is already
		provided by their superclass. In the example, the [ sparrow ] and the [
		ostrich ] subclasses provide their own implementation of the flight
		method. This is a from of polymorphism known as method overriding.
	</p>
	<p class="pText">
		So, when a method is invoked, which version of the method is to be
		executed is determined based on the type of object being invoked on. If
		it's a [ Bird ] object, [ Bird ]s version of [ flight ] is called. If
		it's a [ sparrow ]. or [ ostrich ] object, their respective version of [
		flight ] are called. This ability to "take many forms" is the essence of
		polymorphism.

    <h2 class="h2Title">Common use cases</h2>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Creating Reusable Code</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Polymorphism allows you to write code that does
		not need to be changed when a new derived class is added, which makes
		your code more reusable. You can write a function or method that uses a
		base class type and it will be able to handle any objects of classes
		derived from that base class.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Implementing Interface Polymorphism</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		In languages that support
		interfaces (like Java or C#), polymorphism is often used to implement
		classes that share the same methods but have different implementations.
		This is a powerful way to decouple your code and make it more modular
		and flexible.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Design Patterns:</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		Many design patterns in OOP use polymorphism. For
		example, in the Strategy pattern, a context object contains a reference
		to a strategy object, and delegates all requests to that object. The
		strategy object can be changed to change the behavior of the context
		object.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Abstract Classes and Methods</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		In some languages, you can define abstract
		classes and methods that provide a base level of functionality, but
		require subclasses to provide specific implementations. This is a form
		of polymorphism.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Graphics and User Interface</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		In graphical and user interface
		programming, polymorphism is used extensively. For example, you might
		have a base [ Shape ] class and derived classes like [ Circle ], [
		Rectangle ], etc. You can then write code that works with [ Shape ]
		objects, and it will work with any derived shape objects.
	</p>
    <h3 class="h3Title">Game programming</h3>
	<p class="pExplain">
		In game programming, polymorphism is used to manage
		and manipulate collections of different types of game objects. For
		example, you might have a base [ GameObject ] class and derived classes
		like [ Player ], [ Alien ], [ Asteroid ], etc./p>
	</p>
	<p class="pSummary">
		The main benefit of polymorphism is that it allows you to write more
		flexible and reusable code by allowing objects of different classes to
		be treated as objects of a common superclass.
