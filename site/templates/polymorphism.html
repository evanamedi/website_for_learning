<h1 class="topic-title">Polymorphism</h1>
<p class="margin-top">The word "Polymorphism" comes from Greek and means "many shapes". In programming, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.</p>
<p class="margin-top">Breakdown:</p>
<p>Subtyping: Subtyping, also known as subtype polymorphism, is a form of polymorphism in which a subclass is datatype that is a subtype of a superclass. The superclass can be used to refer to the subclass object. In other words, a reference variable of a superclass can point to an object of the subclass.</p>
<p>Method Overriding: Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</p>
<p>Operator Overloading: Operator overloading is a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to provide the special meaning to the user-defined data type. Operator overloading is used to perform operations on user-defined data type like complex numbers, fractions, etc.</p>
<p class="margin-top">Example of polymorphism in Python (also previously used to demonstrate inheritance):</p>
<pre class="code-box">
    <code>
class Bird:
    def intro(self):
        print("There are many types of birds.")

    def flight(self):
        print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

class sparrow(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Sparrows can fly.")

class ostrich(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

bird1 = Bird()
bird2 = sparrow()
bird3 = ostrich()

bird1.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
bird1.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Most of the birds can fly but some cannot."</span>

bird2.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
bird2.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Sparrows can fly."</span>

bird3.intro()	<span class="comment"># prints "There are many types of birds."</span>
bird3.flight()	<span class="comment"># prints "Ostriches cannot fly."</span>
    </code>
</pre>
<p>In the above program, we defined two classes [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ], both are subclasses of [ Bird ]. A method named [ flight ] is created in [ Bird ] class and overridden in both subclasses. This is a perfect example of polymorphism as the method [ flight ] is taking multiple forms.</p>
<p>Polymorphism allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class. As the key aspect of polymorphism is that it provides flexibility and loose coupling so that code can be extended and easily maintained over time.</p>
<p class="margin-top">The previous explanation focused on inheritance. Inheritance is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. In the example, [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ] classes are derived from the [ Bird ] class, hence they inherit the intro method from the [ Bird ] class.</p>
<p>The current explanation focuses on polymorphism, which is a concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a superclass. In the context of the example, both [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ] classes override the [ flight ] method of the [ Bird ] class. When we call the [ flight ] method on an object of type [ Bird ], [ sparrow ], or [ ostrich ], the appropriate version of the method is executed based on the actual type of the object. This is polymorphism in action.</p>
<p class="margin-top">Further Explanation:</p>
<p>Inheritance: Is the mechanism where a class (the subclass) can derive or inherit properties and methods from another class (the superclass). In the given example, [ sparrow ] and [ ostrich ] are subclasses that inherit from the [ Bird ] superclass, and this they inherit the [ into ] and [ flight ] methods.</p>
<p>Polymorphism: On the other hand, is the ability of the subclasses to provide their own specific  implementation of a method that is already provided by their superclass. In the example, the [ sparrow ] and the [ ostrich ] subclasses provide their own implementation of the flight method. This is a from of polymorphism known as method overriding.</p>
<p>So, when a method is invoked, which version of the method is to be executed is determined based on the type of object being invoked on. If it's a [ Bird ] object, [ Bird ]s version of [ flight ] is called. If it's a [ sparrow ]. or [ ostrich ] object, their respective version of [ flight ] are called. This ability to "take many forms" is the essence of polymorphism.</p>
<p class="margin-top">Common use cases:</p>
<p>Creating Reusable Code: Polymorphism allows you to write code that does not need to be changed when a new derived class is added, which makes your code more reusable. You can write a function or method that uses a base class type and it will be able to handle any objects of classes derived from that base class.</p>
<p>Implementing Interface Polymorphism: In languages that support interfaces (like Java or C#), polymorphism is often used to implement classes that share the same methods but have different implementations. This is a powerful way to decouple your code and make it more modular and flexible.</p>
<p>Design Patterns: Many design patterns in OOP use polymorphism. For example, in the Strategy pattern, a context object contains a reference to a strategy object, and delegates all requests to that object. The strategy object can be changed to change the behavior of the context object.</p>
<p>Abstract Classes and Methods: In some languages, you can define abstract classes and methods that provide a base level of functionality, but require subclasses to provide specific implementations. This is a form of polymorphism.</p>
<p>Graphics and User Interface: In graphical and user interface programming, polymorphism is used extensively. For example, you might have a base [ Shape ] class and derived classes like [ Circle ], [ Rectangle ], etc. You can then write code that works with [ Shape ] objects, and it will work with any derived shape objects.</p>
<p>Game programming: In game programming, polymorphism is used to manage and manipulate collections of different types of game objects. For example, you might have a base [ GameObject ] class and derived classes like [ Player ], [ Alien ], [ Asteroid ], etc./p>
<p>The main benefit of polymorphism is that it allows you to write more flexible and reusable code by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.</p>
