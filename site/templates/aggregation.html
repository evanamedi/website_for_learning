	<h1 class="my-10 text-yellow-100 text-2xl">Aggregation</h1>
	<p>
		Aggregation is a special form of association in OOP. It represents a
		"has-as"" relationship between two classes, where one class is a complex
		entity that consists of one or more other classes, but there is still
		independence of the classes.

		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Definition:</h3>
		<p>
			Aggregation is a relationship where one class (the "whole" or
			"parent") has a reference to another class (the "part" or "child"),
			but the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, a
			Car might have an Engine. The car is the whole entity that uses the
			engine, but the engine could exist without the car.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Independence:</h3>
		<p>
			In an aggregation relationship, the child can exist independently of
			the parent. If the parent is deleted, the child can continue to
			exist. For example, if you delete a Car object, the Engine object
			can still exist.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Lifecycle:</h3>
		<p>
			The lifecycle of the child is not managed by the parent. The child
			can be created and deleted independently.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Direction:</h3>
		<p>
			Aggregation is typically a one-way relationship. The parent knows
			about the child, but the child does not know about the parent.
		</p>

<code>
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine	# the Car has an Engine

engine = Engine("V8")           # create an Engine instance

car = Car("Toyota", engine)     # create a Car instance with Engine
</code>
</pre>
		<p class="mt-5">
			In this example, the [ Car ] class has an aggregation relationship
			with the [ Engine ] class. The [ Car ] has an [ Engine ], but the [
			Engine ] can exist independently of the [ Car ].
