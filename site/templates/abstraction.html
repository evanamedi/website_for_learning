	<h1 class="my-10 text-yellow-100 text-2xl">Abstraction</h1>
		<p>
			Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex details of an
			operation while providing a simpler interface.
		</p>
        <h2 class="mt-16 text-yellow-100 text-xl">Key Points:</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Data Abstraction:</h3>
		<p>
			Data abstraction is about providing only essential information to
			the outside world while hiding their background details, i.e., how
			the data is stored and operations are performed. In other words, the
			user interacts with only the information that is necessary, while
			the underlying complexities and hidden from the user.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Method Abstraction:</h3>
		<p>
			This is achieved by creating methods that perform complex
			operations, but providing a simple interface for them. The user
			doesn't need to know how the method does what it does- they just
			need to know what it does.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Abstract Classes and Methods:</h3>
		<p>
			In some programming languages like Java & C#, you can create
			abstract classes and methods. An abstract class is a class that
			cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain
			abstract methods (methods declared without an implementation) as
			well as concrete methods (methods with an implementation).
			Subclasses of an abstract class are generally expected to provide an
			implementation for the abstract methods./p>
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">Interface:</h3>
		<p>
			An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only
			abstract methods. In languages that support interfaces, they are a
			powerful way to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-yellow-100">
			Encapsulation and Information Hiding:
		</h3>
		<p>
			Abstraction is closely related to encapsulation and information
			hiding. Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that
			operate on that data within one unit, and information hiding is
			about making the data inaccessible to the outside world. Abstraction
			takes this a step further by not only hiding the data, but also by
			hiding how the methods of a class are implemented.
		</p>
		<p class="my-20">
			The main advantage of abstraction is that it reduces complexity by
			breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts.
			This is also increases the maintainability, reusability, and
			modularity of the code. It allows you to change the implementation
			of an abstracted operation without affecting the rest of the code,
			as long as the interface stays the same.
		</p>
		<p class="my-10">
			Consider an example of a payment processing system. In this system,
			we have different payment methods like Credit Card, Debit Card, and
			PayPal. Each payment method follows the same process: authorize the
			payment and then charge the payment. However, the implementation
			details for each payment method are different.

			In this code, [ PaymentMethod ] is an abstract base class that
			declares two abstract methods: [ authorize ] and [ charge ]. [
			CreditCard ] and [ PayPay ] are concrete classes that inherit from [
			PaymentMethod ] and provide their own implementations of these
			methods.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			The [ PaymentProcessor ] class has a [ process_payment ] method that
			takes a [ PaymentMethod ] object and calls its [ authorize ] and [
			charge ] methods. This method doesn't need to know what specific
			type [ PaymentMethod ] it's dealing with, it just knows that it can
			call [ authorize ] and [ charge ] on it. This is abstraction in
			action.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5 text-yellow-100">More detailed explanation:</p>
		<p>
			In the system, [ PaymentMethod ] is an abstract base class (ABC)
			that defines a common interface for all payment methods. This
			interface includes two methods: [ authorize ] and [ charge ]. These
			methods are marked as abstract, meaning they have no implementation
			in [ PaymentMethod ] and must be implemented by any concrete (i.e.,
			non-abstract) subclass.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			[ CreditCard ] and [ PayPal ] are concrete classes that inherit from
			[ PaymentMethod ] and provide their own implementations of the [
			authorize ] and [ charge ] methods. These implementations contain
			the specific steps required to authorize and charge a payment using
			each method.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			The [ PaymentProcessor ] class represents the part of the system
			that processes payments. It has a [ process_payment ] method that
			takes an object of type [ PaymentMethod ] and called its [ authorize
			] and [ charge ] methods. This method doesn't need to know the
			details of how each payment method authorized and charges payments;
			it just needs to know that it can call [ authorize ] and [ charge ]
			on any [ PaymentMethod ] object.
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			This is where the power of abstraction comes in. By defining a
			common interface for all payment methods, we can write code in [
			PaymentProcessor ] that works with any payment method, regardless of
			its specific implementation. This makes [ PaymentProcessor ] more
			flexible and easier to maintain. If we want to add a new payment
			method in the future, we just need to create a new class that
			implements the [ PaymentMethod ] interface; we don't need to change
			any code in [ PaymentProcessor ].
		</p>
		<p class="my-5">
			Abstraction in this context is used to hide the complex details of
			authorizing and charging different types of payments, while
			providing a simple, consistent interface for processing any type of
			payment. This reduces complexity, improves maintainability, and
			makes the code more flexible and extensible.
